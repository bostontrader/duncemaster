/**
 *
 * In these tests I generally want to test that:
 *
 * 1. A controller method exists...
 *
 * 2. Said method returns the correct response code.
 *
 * 3. Said method does or does not redirect.  If it redirects, then where to?
 *
 * 4. A bare minimum of html structure required to reasonably verify correct operation
 *    and to facilitate TDD.  For example, the add method should return a form with certain fields.
 *
 * 5. Verify that the db has changed as expected, if applicable.
 *
 * I do not want to test:
 *
 * 1. Whether or not Auth prevents/allows access to a method.
 *
 * 2. How the method responds to badly formed requests, such as trying to submit a DELETE to the add method.
 *
 * 3. Any html structure, formatting, css, scripts, tags, krakens, or whatever, beyond the bare minimum
 *    listed above.
 *
 * These items should be tested elsewhere.
 *
 * Although tempting to test for viewVars, resist the urge.  If they are not set correctly then
 * there will be actual consequences that the testing will catch.  At best looking for viewVars
 * is a debugging aid.  At worst, we'll eat a lot of time picking them apart.  Just say No.
